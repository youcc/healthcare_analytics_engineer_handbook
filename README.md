# Healthcare Analytics Engineer Handbook

This handbook aims to bridge the gap between healthcare domain knowledge and techincal analytics skills -- something I wish I had when starting my journey in this field. 

I welcome your contributions, feedback, and suggestions as we continue to build this resource together. Whether you're a seasoned healthcare analytics professional or just starting your journey, there's a place for you in this community!

## Getting started
I like the Data Roles Continuum created by [Zack Wilson](https://x.com/EcZachly/status/1853677599647736255). For comprehensive data engineering resources, his [Data Engineer Handbook](https://github.com/DataExpert-io/data-engineer-handbook) is excellent.

It's interesting to note that while many healthcare analytics professionals are titled "data analyts" or "data scientists", they frequently perform tasks fall under "data engineering." This is why many end up functioning as "analytics engineers" in practice.

Across all fields, professionals typically need three essential capabilities: business knowledge, soft skills, and hard skills.
